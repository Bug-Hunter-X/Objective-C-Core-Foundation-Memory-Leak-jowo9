In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with Core Foundation objects.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
CFStringRef myString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
// ... some code ... 
// Forgot to release the string
```

Failing to release the `CFStringRef` using `CFRelease(myString)` leads to a memory leak. The program might appear to function correctly for a while, but over time, memory usage will continuously increase, eventually causing crashes or performance issues.  This is particularly problematic because Core Foundation objects are not managed by ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).
