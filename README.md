This repository demonstrates a common memory leak in Objective-C when working with Core Foundation objects. The `bug.m` file shows the incorrect code that forgets to release a CFStringRef, leading to a memory leak. The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected code with the proper CFRelease call to prevent the memory leak. This example highlights the importance of meticulous memory management when using Core Foundation objects in Objective-C, especially outside of ARC's automatic handling.
